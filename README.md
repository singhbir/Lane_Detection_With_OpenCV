# Lane_Detection_With_OpenCV
I have Created Lane Detection System With OpenCV and CannyEdge  Detection 

## Libraries Required 
1. **cv2** - This Library is used to Read The Image
2. **numpy** - This library is used to work with arrays 

Install these Libraries with pip command
**Download Video from https://github.com/rslim087a/road-video this link** 

## Running The Script 
1. open cmd 
2. Type **python lane.py** and hit enter 
3. you will see that Video is running in Which All the Lines are Detected 
4. If you want to Check it with Image just Uncomment the commented code  and comment the all code next to that 
5. Now it will detect lines on the Image
